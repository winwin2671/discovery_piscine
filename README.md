FYI:

Copying code without proper attribution or permission is a violation of academic honesty and can lead to severe consequences, such as failing the assignment or even expulsion from the program.

Using code written by others without fully understanding how it works or without giving credit can also be problematic. It may lead to errors in your program, and you may not be able to explain your solution if asked to do so.

In some cases, copying code may seem like a quick solution, but it ultimately harms your ability to learn and improve your coding skills. You may miss out on valuable learning opportunities by not trying to solve the problem yourself.

Academic honesty is not just about avoiding plagiarism; it's also about being truthful and transparent in your work. If you copy code from someone else, you are not being honest about your abilities or your understanding of the material.

Finally, copying code undermines the integrity of the educational institution and the value of the degree or certificate that you are working towards. It is essential to maintain high standards of academic honesty to ensure that everyone is evaluated fairly and accurately.
